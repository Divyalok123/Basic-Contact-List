<h2>Basic Contact List</h2>
<hr>
It's a basic contact list web app built using <strong>NodeJS (with Express) </strong>, <strong>MongoDB (with Mongoose) </strong>. <br>
<strong>EJS</strong> was used as template engine. <br>

It includes basic functionalities like: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Adding contacts</li>
  <li>Deleting contacts</li>
  <li>Updating contacts (I'll be adding this later)</li>
</ul>

<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Contributions and suggestions are most welcome :)
